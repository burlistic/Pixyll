Below is an email template to help convince your boss that sendng you or your team to a developer confernece is well worth the investment. 

I am a big fan of developer conferneces and have attended several over the years. They are a great way for you to stay up to date and pasionate about building software.

Most organisations require justification for the ticket purchase and time off to attend. I am hoping the email below might help save you some time and build a compelling case for your attendace.

## Email Template

Dear <strong>{Boss}</strong>,

I would like to attend conference <strong>{conference name}</strong> on <strong>{insert date}</strong> and was hoping you would support this request by approving the funding of the ticket and time off to attend.

Developer conferences are a great in many ways and are incredibly good value in terms of training effectiveness. At these conferences you get a rare opportunity to network and meet contacts in the industry, including people from further afield who are attending or speaking, potential clients and future colleagues.

You get up to speed on the latest trends, toolsets and emerging technologies. This helps to refresh the love of development and re-invigorate your passion. Which can sometimes suffer in even the most dedicated programmer!. All those project and sprint deadlines can begin to wear you down after a little while.

The learning attained by going to conference will help me deliver future projects. Meeting industry peers and thought leaders often gives you a new perspective and ultimately leads to you becoming better at your job. There can also be a chance to find solutions to present challenges or get new ideas on an upcoming work assignments.

I look forward to hearing back from you regarding this personal development and training request.

Many thanks
