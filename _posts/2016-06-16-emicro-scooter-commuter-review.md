## Intro

When I first saw the new emicro online I knew I wanted one. It took a long while before it was finally on the market, and took even longer than expected to arrive due to some issues getting it approved for sale in the Australian market.

Three months in and I use the scooter on a daily basis.  The scooter has clever technology to assist your propulsion; the harder you kick the more the motor drives. The tech in the scooter recognises when you approach a gradient, so it can power you up hills with little effort.

## Stats

- 12 km range (although I have been 14km with plenty of battery spare)
- 25 km top speed
- 1 hr charge
- 500 watt motor
- 7.5kg weight

## Tips

The sweet spot for the scooter is short journeys over smooth surfaces. I ride my scooter 3km to the station, then fold it away to board the train. The scooter really comes into it's own when I have another journey at the other end of my train ride. It was a great mode of transport as a consultant, as I could visit different client sides with ease or make it back to HQ for meetings or special interest groups.

Rough roads can be a little hard to stomach at first due to the limited absorption from the tyres. After a while you get used to rougher surfaces, as you bit up strength in your legs.

## Safety

So far I haven't come off the scooter (I have touched the wooden table beside me just in case...). I use my bright USB bike lights for visibility. I would recommend wearing a helmet for longer journeys on busy roads.

## Feedback from others?

I was naturally a bit self conscious at first. Folding away the scooter awkwardly on the train I felt like a bit of a scooter geek. But after a week I realised no-one really cares and I got use to folding it away on the move.

Most people I come across are genuinely interested in my new mode of transport and it is a great conversation starter. Plus I do not really mind standing out from the crowd!

## Where can I get one?

Head over to your local [emicro website](https://www.microscooters.com.au/emicro-one). 

## Conclusion

The scooter has been great so far. I would recommend using it as a commuter for trips of 3-4km on smooth quiet roads or good cycle paths. Rougher ground can be hard work, but in smaller doses it is fine.

The scooter come into it's own if you have a journey either side of a train ride. Scooting it is great fun and an environmentally friendly way of getting around.
