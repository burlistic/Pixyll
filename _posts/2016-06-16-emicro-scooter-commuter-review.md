## Intro

When I first saw the new emicro online I knew I wanted one. It took a long while before it was finally on the market, and took even longer than expected to arrive due to some issues getting it approved for sale in the Australian market.

Three months in and I am impressed and use the scooter on a daily basis.  The scooter uses clever technology to assist your propulsion; the harder you kick the more the motor drives. The software imbedded recognises when you approach a gradient, so it can power you up hills with little effort. It takes a little while to learn to ride the scooter well and get maximum power with little effort.

## Stats

- 12 km range (although I have been 14km with plenty of battery spare)
- 25 km top speed
- 1 hr charge
- 500 watt motor
- 7.5kg weight

## Tips

The sweet spot for the scooter is short journeys over smooth surfaces. I ride my scooter 3km to the station, then fold it away to board the train. The scooter really came into it's own when I can a simular journey after alighting at my destination. It was a great mode of transport as a consultant, as I could visit different client sides with ease or make it back to HQ for meetings or speciali interest group (guilds).

Rough road can be a little hard to stomach at first due to the limited absorbtion from the tyres. After a while you get used to rougher surfaces, perhaps as you bit up strength in your legs. By rough ground I mean anything you wouldn;t fancy skateboarding over (in your younger years).

Do not try to carry coffee on your scooter using your sons or daughters micro drink holder.. It will go everywhere.

Check the power settings. I thought I had it on max power but adjusting it again recently has given it a major power boost.

## Safety

So far I haven't come off the scooter (I have touched the wooden table beside me just in case...). I use my bright USB bike lights for visability, one on the handle bars the other on my bag on the rear. I trailed a helment but it was inconveint when carring around the scooter on the train.

## Feedback from others?

I was naturally a bit self concious at first. Folding away the scooter akwardly on the train I felt like a bit of a scooter geek. But after a week I realised no-one really cares and I got use to folding it away on the move with a bit more grace.

Most people I come across at geninuly interested in my new mode of transport and it is a great conversation starter. Plus I do not really mind standing out from the crowd!

## Where can I get one?

Head over to your local [emicro website](https://www.microscooters.com.au/emicro-one). 

## Conclusion

The scooter has been great so far. I would recommend using it as a commuter for trips of 3-4km on smooth quiet roads or good cycle paths. Rougher ground can be hard work, but in smaller doses it is fine.

The scooter come into it's own if you have a journey either side of a train ride. Scooting it is great fun and an environmentally freindly way of getting around.

Get one!
