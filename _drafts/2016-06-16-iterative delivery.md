#Iterative

Not assuming that you will get it write first time

Building software that can be released and verfied

Embracing emergent behaviours and a change in direct

Not being afraid of making changes in order to build a better product

#Incremental

Build a product bit by bit

Chnages assumed to not be required - chance of rework low

Essay example

Incremetal planning (a plan is a plan.. no rework required on passed plans)

Incrementing on tiers (DB, middle tier, front end) - why this is not a good idea

Incrementing of features (up front analysis and detailed specs - investment to ensure changes are not required post build (suit less complex scenarios))

Famous examples of incremental vs iterative - mona lisa, car vs skateboard

It is not that simple. Sometimes both are needed.

Classic scenario of the linear model and where it can go wrong?

Challanges (specs to be agreed up front or potentail conflict inevitable)
Specifications can become out of date quilcky and a maintenance overhead

Large investment in specification whereas a large portion of the the time, money and effort could spend writting and validating software
