This is a guide to fixed price contracts and the alternative methods of delivery for software development. It is based on a discussion I facilitated at a Agile Perth Lunch time session. It was a hot topic and generated and insightful discussion. Thanks for everyone who took part and helped shape our understanding of this common challange.

## What is a Fixed Price Contract - in a Traditional Sense

<blockquote>
A contract to deliver software which fixes the price, outcome or scope and often the timeline
</blockquote>

# Scope

In a traditional sense a 'fixed priced contract' details specific scope, usually in a formal specification document.
 
# Delivery Time

A fixed price contract will often also fix the delivery date. 

# Price

Clients are very keen to get a fixed price up front for software build. This is understandable in an industry where projects, espcially large complex ones, often goes over budget.



The traditional fixed price contract is seen as the best tool for limiting  customers risk. Unfortunatley this is not normally the best approach and there are much better ways of managing risk and predictability using iterative delievery methods.


## Why this is a problem - challenges faced

# Flexability

Obviously fixing a contract on spefic deliverables makes it harder to change the requirements. Re-negotiations are likey to be required which can be tricky, especially if there is an unforseen cost increases.

# Easy to Blow Budget

Forecasting budgets for complex IT projects is proven to be very challenging. Quite often large projects overrun spectacualry.

# Quality at Risk

It is ofen quality that suffers if a project becomes understress. The first thing to be cut is noramlly testing, reviews and refactoring - both important element in code quality and on going maintainability. This often comes about where there is a looming deadline and time is running out. 

# Can Cost More

A project can end up costing more as the management and time factors involved running a fixed price project adds additional overheads. Large projects might need months of analysis up front and contract negititation. Then the customer might not see a release of software until completion.

# Change Management / Client Relationship

Change management needs to be well managed and adds additional complexity. The client relations can also suffer. Re-negotiation of contacts and extentions puts stress on a client / consultant relaionship. Especially if the orginal plan or esitamte was incorrect and there was not an adequte buffer to account for unforeseen challanges.

# Conways Law / Client Culture

## Alternatives

# Fixed price / variable scope

Another way to fix a price of a contract is to agree a price for a fixed period delivery and have high level scope which will be the target goal. This is sometimes referred to as fixed price and variable scope or time and materials - the later description I do not believe fits the complex world of software delivery.

# Control the schedue

A project roadmap can be used to plan several of these fixed periods and the outcomes sought. This can be controlled and refined during delivery. Risk is limited to each of the agreed fixed price periods and the schedule matures and can become more precise over time.

# Set customer expectations

Build up a strong working relationship based on trust and keep working on it. It is in the interest of both parties to succeed and deliver a solution. Explain why fixing detailed scope and budgets of complex project in advance can put a project under stress and increased risk. Commit to delivering the best possible solution for the client and project break out opporuntities.

# Help your customer to sell approach to strakeholders

One of the most difficult challanges is gettign the agreement of upper management and board memebers of the merits of an itterative apporach. Help your client do this and provide them with any support they might need. For example provides some case studies, white papers, metrics or offer to meet the stakeholders and disuss the approach with them directly. Any time spend in getting support from upper maangement will be well worth it.

# Spike early and continue until risk is lower - then fix a price if required

If you client is keen on fixing a price then you can propose a series or spikes (proof of concepts) to build an better understanding. Keep doing this until both parties have an agreed understanding which will allow for fixing a price with better accurancy.

This will limit the percived exposure on the clients side but still give you many of the most important benefit of an itterative apporach - which is not assuming and prediciting too much up front.

# Needs instead of wants

By having an agile emergent approach the client can focus more on value of the backlog and has the opporunity to change their mind during the build. This can be immesmly valuable, especially for projects where there is a high degree of complexity and new ideas and betterunderstanding of the problem will emerge over time. This generally will result in a better quality outcome and the more important features will naturally get more focus - especially if the softaware is demonstrated and tested with realy users during the build.

## Key Take Aways

# Fixed price requires better risk management

Fixing the price and specific outcomes up front agitates the risk and makes a complex project more likely to come understress and to be challanged. As a result extra risk mitigration is often required. This can included; increased margin for budget, controlled change management process, detailed up front anlaysis, thorough negotation and specific agreements on deliverables.

# Understand your customer

Relationship

# Smaller Milestones Preferable
